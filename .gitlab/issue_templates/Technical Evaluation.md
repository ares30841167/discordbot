- [ ] Clearly document the topic to evaluated in this issue description
- [ ] Determine specific scope including time-bounds for investigation

### Tasks to  Evaluate

(Outline the tasks with issues that you need to evaluate as a part of the implementation issue)

- [ ] Determine feasibility of the feature
- [ ] Create issue for implementation or update existing implementation issue description with implementation proposal 
- [ ] Set weight on implementation issue
- [ ] If weight is greater than 5, break issue into smaller issues
- [ ] Add task 
- [ ] Add task
